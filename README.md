# HAS
A Hide and Seek Spigot plugin I created circa 2021. Written for version 1.17.1, but can most likely be built for other versions as well.

I began rewriting this a while ago given that the existing code is poor, but I haven't found the time to finish it.
## Usage
This isn't really intended for use, as most of the configuration for the game is hardcoded in the source code itself. The map that was meant to be used with this plugin ("hasyan") was the Akademi High School, which can be found [here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/yandere-simulator-high-school-final-java-edition-version-1-16-3-pe-and-windows-10/).
